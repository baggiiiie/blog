Speaking of this, I muted you. Definitely not because I hate you.  

It's mainly because I mute most faces that I don't see on a regular basis, and I kinda wanna just treat you like one of them, 'cause you are one of them by this criterion. Perhaps also becasue you symbolize too much of my painful history that I have not yet learned how to accept. And perhaps I empower your stories too much and am scared to see them popping up in my feed, because 3 seconds of that would have the potential to fuck up my day, days, or weeks.  

These are probably why I muted you, but it has not done any good. The intention was to not having to see you unexpectedly, and just, normalize your existence. But that didn't really happen. Muting you merely adds another step of typing your initials in the search bar, the behavior of which could backfire and become addictive, making it more uneasy on the mind. I guess addictive is the right word. It's endowed with a gambling-like characteristic, pretty much a one-arm bandit. The difference is I don't know what I'm even looking for to begin with.  

I guess, I muted you so I can passively avoid you, but how could I passively avoid you when I’m also actively seeking.  


You probably symbolize too much of that painful history I was talking about. Thinking about it, I feel bitter, repulsed. These two words are the closest depiction, if only there's a better word to describe. I haven't learned how to react to it. And when I think about you, as a part of that period - a tiny part from the aspect of time, a not-so-tiny part from the aspects of energy and mental capacity - I feel exactly the same. I haven't learned how to react to you ever since then.  

  

Thinking about that period of time, fortunately, I also feel grateful. Grateful that I moved on and I moved out. I moved out of the mental prison I drew for myself, and out of the dark, if not the darkest, time of my entire existence so far.   
I guess I kinda wanna share this piece of information with you. I kinda wanna just let you know I moved out. I am a bit less of a fuckup day by day, and now I don’t think I’d call myself a fuckup anymore. For some reason, I kinda wanna let you know. Let you know that I’m better, and probably that I’m sorry you saw my worst. At the same time, I wanna let you know, so I can have a chance to conjecture if you care.  


I wanna let you know I’m better, but I’m not really the person I want to be just yet. I don’t wanna just present myself before I’m ready.  

I wanna let you know I’m better, but why, what’s the point. What's the point of letting you know. Perhaps to revert your impression on me, or to repair some of the damage done to you, if any. As I’m writing down this, unable to dig into a deeper why, I know it could be nothing more than a desire to share the info and prove myself to both you and myself. Without exaggeration, I'm not the person I used to be and not the person you used to know. To some extend, I really don’t wanna be simply perceived as a shitty person, especially by those who have seen my vulnerabilities. I must have been really really shitty from your perspective. I mean, I was really really shitty from my now respective - I let you see my vulnerabilities and shitty side, and you should see me better.


Don’t think I’d do it. Your life, of which I have no right to come and go into, is totally different from mine. Without that period of time and without you being sort of a symbol of it, I wouldn’t feel as attached. With that as a part of me, I don't think you'd appreciate what I have experienced and what I have learned. Things would have probably been already different otherwise.  


I do aware that it's not a common experience, it's not common for the majority to understand. And I think, from our interactions, you are one of them. You are the majority, and I think I'm not, which, sooner or later, would lead to the topic of compatibility.  

Not blaming or being condescending though. My experience has set me apart from the majority. Before I could find the balance, I had made myself basically incomprehensible. If anything, I blame myself for it, and for not realizing it or even indulging in it.  


And I unmuted you last night. I do not enjoy the extra step of typing. The behavior amplifies itself and makes what could be a part of doom scrolling a conscious decision. I do not enjoy making that decision. It's unnecessary and achieves the opposite of normalizing your existence. I shot myself in the foot. So, before you become one of them, if you ever will, I have chosen to unmute you, letting you be.  


At the end of the day, you're just part of my life long journey. That dark period was painful but beautiful nonetheless. And getting to know you was all that, too. At the end of the day, I still think you're a friend, or you could be a friend. We were never really friends, I guess. I value this experience enough to mute and unmute, and enough to wanna know how are you doing, what's your plan, do you love your job, and what are we getting for our next dinner. How you like your morning coffee - or do you drink at all - remains unknown, and I have grown to be fine with it.
