29 June

People running, people chilling. People running to the departure after chilling for slightly too long, and people chilling at the charging station after running to be 3 hours early.  

The moment you make it and have your baggages checked in, it suddenly all calms down. Calm enough to notice there're annoying kids running around and it takes exactly 5 minutes before you get fully annoyed; and notice the family in the same checking queue are now unpacking two suitcases and fighting to zip them back up.

Mood sometimes swings to another extreme. After the brief calmness, or even before the stress and anxiety could fully dissipate, other emotions rush in. Might be a flood of wistful nostalgia and deep attachment to memories, might be a surge of excitement and yearning for new adventures.  

The same applies to arrival. The same hecticness. Anxiety remains palpable. Overwhelmed by hotel pickups first thing after landing. Later navigating with two bulky luggages and a carry-on in tow. For some it's happy reunion for others it's painful reality. Joyful faces looking forward to new chapter of life five meters away, and sad ones returning to an old chapter (they'd eventually come to realize it's still gonna be a new chapter nonetheless; took me a while).

Airport sendoffs are always more gentle on the sendoff-ees than the sendoff-ers. Being sent off signifies exploration and excitement, and security check is a welcome distraction. Unpacking and packing certainly dilute emotions. A stroll through duty frees also soothes the mind. Meanwhile, sendoff-ers are returning to normalcy, often with a part missing, whether huge or small. Regular days being altered, wouldn't be as regular as how they used to be. It becomes quieter, tamer. Harder to bear sometimes.

Maybe what I just wrote was wrong. It's gentle on neither. After being sent off, whatever lies ahead might not be particularly exciting. It's the very thing that some would later try to escape from.

This is only yapping. After another sendoff, the unexplainable uneasiness creeped in. Perhaps for sendoff-ers, sendoffs also symbolize a new chapter of life. With the experience from last chapter, it is something new after all. The change would be noticeable. It'd become a bit duller, a bit calmer; somewhat more conducive, a touch less daring.  

I will miss it. I will move on. For now I will let it sink in as I yap.
