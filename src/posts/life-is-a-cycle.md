Life is a cycle, it's a self repeating loop. As covered in *[I'm becoming boring](I'm-Becoming-Boring)*, majority of life is the boring bits. The word *boring* has too much of negative connotation to it, but I meant it in the most neutral way - simply the fact that majority of life is the same things happening again and again. Same cereal every morning, same route to work every weekday, same clothes every wardrobe rotation. While occasional surprises may arise, the rhythm of everyday life generally follows familiar patterns. It's a self-repeating cycle, it's a feedback loop. You either go in the positive feedback loop or the negative one.

Sort of like swimming in the ocean. In a positive loop, we swim fast, the momentum is on our side, it feels easier to swim fast; in a negative loop, we swim slow, with inertia against us, it feels tough, and sometimes impossible to get started. There's a catch with this ocean, though: even when we are swimming fast, even when the momentum is on our side, if we don't look around and relocate ourselves from time to time, we will be drifting along with the waves. In which case, the harder and faster we swim, the further away we are from our destination. 

This might just apply to all aspects of all.
For example, kids who are tall and play basketball. With their height they perform well among other kids and get praised for being a natural, which leads to their enjoyment in the sport and more hard practices, which, like a loop, leads to better performance. They enter the positive loop with the help of some genetic advantages, and stay in the loop more effortlessly.
Or,  let's say, work. You start with a bit more advantages than others, be it soft skills or experience, get noticed and assigned more important projects with more visibility, resulting in more exposure and more attention. The process of corporate ladder climbing feels more game-like and even kinda fun. (I have no intention to encourage 内卷 but this definitely somehow sounds like it.)
On a micro-er scale, the loop applies to habit building. Good habits repeats itself, bad ones too. 


### Awareness

I don't know how to break out a negative feedback loop or stay in a positive one. Despite my best efforts and almost-deceptive [self-persuasion](mornings-are-underrated), getting up early, ironically, is what I struggled with the most when it comes to breaking a bad cycle. For no reason, there're phases where I just can't seem to get out of bed. I remember times when I'd wake up feeling energetic with an unreasonable urge to conquer the world. Some other times I'd just be bullshitting myself with the "5 more minutes" or "make it xx o'clock sharp", while clearly knowing it's all BS but helplessly being incapable of moving my lazy ass.

So, yes, I am not in a good position to write a 101 guide. But through my learning and struggles, to break out a bad cycle is to notice.

Most of the time, we are not aware. We are not even aware of what we are doing. I surely know that I am hitting snooze for the 5th time. But that's not the level of awareness that matters. What matters is the awareness that goes beyond "I am doing this again I need to be better", it's self-compassion like "I deserve to be a better version of myself for myself". This kind of awareness overwhelms us, it leaves us at a loss as to what to do. It feels like an electrocution. That's how it should feel - you'd get chills from getting this level of awareness, and even become terrified that you've never had the awareness before.

Being stuck in a bad cycle could feel helpless, it feels like we are not even in control of ourselves, nothing frustrates more. But once you are aware of what's going on with your behavior, with your mind, you don't have to seek control, because you are already in control. Counter-intuitively, being aware - when the level of awareness electrocutes yourself - is already a form of control. 

Upon gaining that level of awareness, I felt like I just woke up from a psychosis. I look at myself and do not understand the decisions I've made. I stopped fighting against my rational mind that's rationalizing why sleeping 5 more minutes would be a good idea for the moment and even helpful for the day. I became aware enough to ignore the reasonings and [submit to discomfort](getting-up-early).


### Drifting

[The devil](https://www.amazon.sg/Outwitting-Devil-Secret-Freedom-Success/dp/1469259036) is constantly going against us. Unfortunately, we don't just get to stay in the positive loop without putting in effort. We will eventually get comfortable being in the loop. Being comfortable isn't any bad on its own, it's the lackadaisical mindset that comes with it is detrimental. In a loop, be it a positive one or a negative one, it's easy to fall into one behavioral pattern and lose the original intention, goal or bigger life vision, and worst of all, lose hope. Despite the fact that we might be the one setting up the positive loop for ourselves after struggles and desperation, we stop thinking about the rationality behind its existence anymore. Without conscious thinking and constant awareness, we might float through life with no real plan or purpose.  

To realize being in the state of drifting is think. Think about why you are doing the same tasks every day, why you are falling in to the same routines every day.

When I do think about it, it didn't take long for me to realize, daily Netflix binge to me (and many other things) is not a conscious effort to seek relaxation, it's more of a habitual behavior that I merely perform; daily work to me is not a way to achieve career progressing, it's more of excuse to avoid doing the hard work. To have - or to provoke, rather - this kind of thinking, we have to read, to experience, to explore, to discover, and to reflect what's been the norm for us but shouldn't be.  

From time to time, I question, "Why am I doing this".
