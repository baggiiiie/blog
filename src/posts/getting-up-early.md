title: Getting Up Early

I have been getting up at an early hour for i don't know how long, definitely more than a month. The earliest I can trace back to was after my trip in end of July. Then a break in end of Aug when I took another trip. And from then till now.

By ‘an early hour’, I didn’t mean anything crazy like 5 AM, although I have definitely felt the so-called “empowerment” of getting up early and might just try to throw myself in the 5 AM club. Been waking at 7 AM, which is probably a normal hour for some demographics. It was for me, it has been for my boarding school years and it was actually considered late. Back then there wasn’t much discipline involved. It was just life doing its magic back then. I had to. When I didn’t have to, the ritual of waking up early just became non-existent.

It’s been years, ever since 5 years ago, that I have lived a life where waking up early doesn’t hold its value. Yeah I mean I know it’s probably good for you in some aspects, and a ton of scientific papers could be used to argue its benefits. But I just didn’t see a point of doing it. And I definitely would not be capable of doing it even if I wanted to.

**Why did I started it then?**

Well, to be completely fair, it’s rather hard to explore and observe what’s going on in your own mind. I didn’t know why do I wanna wake up early, I didn’t how it’s gonna work out, I didn’t know if I need a concrete plan to execute the idea, I didn’t even know what I’m gonna do after waking up early. How does this happen nonetheless?

Back in July, when I moved back, life just suddenly became a lot simpler. First and foremost, it’s become stress free almost. There wasn’t much resistance if I wanna just try to wake up early. There were stressful times for sure, but they weren’t so disruptive. Then, like mentioned above, I have just known that it’s good for you. Although it’s a very vague idea, deep down in my brain some neurons or something just wanna do it for once. And one of the reasons is probably because I started reading in April, I did look forward to reading in the morning. At least there’s something for me to do if I did actually wake up early.

Another factor that has played a huge part in all these, now that I think about it, is I had a clear goal. I actually wanna achieve something. There’s some sort of urgency, some internal pressure, something inside that wanna make changes. I became more positive towards life. Waking up early kinda symbolizes the positivity. And because I have learned my lessons, I have learned the cost of inaction, I do wanna take some actions now. Just do something. Cuz in most scenarios, doing something is probably gonna be more rewarding than doing nothing.

**Is it worth it?**

It’s gonna make me sound like those insane positivity-spreading mf with their superficial words of life philosophy, but, every morning I wake up, it’s such a joy. Such a joy to see my dog and my cat waiting by the balcony door, such a joy to prove to myself that I am capable of waking up early, such a joy to enjoy the solitude, such a joy to stretch and read get in the first sip of caffeine when no one’s up. And just the whole process is intrinsically enjoyable. As how the cycle of cue-trigger-response-reward goes, it’s been giving my such great rewards, which simply is make me feel good about myself first thing in the morning.

To find out the ‘why’ does getting up early feel enjoyable now while it has been such a pain in the ass for such a long time. I don't know. maybe it’s because at the current period of my life I'm optimistic, I'm positive towards life, I’m quote unquote brainwashed with all them self improvement stuff. Getting up early is a way of showing this kinda positivity in life. Whenever I’m doing it, whenever I have done it, it just proves that I'm capable of doing what i wanna do, which is the empowering part of the whole deal. It’s a small W in everyday life.

**How, just how?**

That’s a question I have not had the answer to for a very long time. I could only get out of bed when there’s some things needed to get done in the morning, or when I’m feeling good about life and wanna do something, or when it’s noon. When I did try to wake up early (most of the time for the sake of waking up early cuz I know I probably should, though the idea was not supported by any strong motivation, or really, just any reason that’s convincing enough to myself), needless to say how much of a struggle it’d be. First off, maybe a bit of mental struggle while still in bed, then snooze is hit and hours pass; or, while hitting the snooze, mindless scrolling starts and tiredness already accumulates though day just starts; or, I wouldn’t even know how, alarm gets switched off. I’m not one that can sleep through screaming alarms, which is good I guess. Later in the day, sometimes I’d get motivated again, sometimes I’d get frustrated, sometimes I’d give up. What’s consistent was feeling completely sh-t every morning.

Wow just writing writing down this, it’s incredible how much I used to struggle and how I’m enjoying it right now. I probably wouldn’t be able to talk my past self into it. Probably wouldn’t be able to convince anyone to do it. Yea, I mean, you can put down all sorts of evidence but just from my personal experience, when you’re too deep into the vicious cycle, you really just need to make the change internally. You need to want to make a change. Not the “I should probably sleep early and wake up early” kind of change. For me, it’s the “I can’t keep being a f-ing loser anymore” kind of change. External forces are only for guidance, for tips and tricks when it comes to execution, not for eliminating a bad habit that’s been drilled into the roots of your brain and neurons. (side note, neurons that wire together fire together, i.e., when a task is frequently performed, the neurons involved form behavioral patterns of themselves too. When fighting against a bad habit, you’re not using your willpower to fight your inner evil voice, you’re fighting against the behavioral patterns in your brain.)

**What’s the tips and tricks then?**

Well, it’s a stupidly simple task, really. Just wake up early, get the f out of bed when the alarm goes off. That’s it. It’s a stupidly simple task.

This just sounds like over-simplification. I know. But again, it’s a stupidly simple task. It’s literally just one single motion to complete the task: get out of your bed.

Just don’t get ahead of yourself and make it more complicated than it really is. I have struggled with it for years. I know the pain. And I know the root cause is probably because you want to get up early, but you don’t want it enough to do whatever it takes, but at the same time, you also want it enough to feel sh-t about yourself when you fail to do it. If you’re not going to do whatever it takes, the execution is gonna be tough.

I have probably made it sound scary for saying “whatever it takes”, but it’s not. If you’re not going to do “whatever it takes”, you probably don’t want it enough. Once you wanna do “whatever it takes”, you have the attitude and determination. Work on how you treat this problem, work on your mindset and attitude towards this problem. Then work on the problem itself. With the correct mindset and strong purpose, the task is really just simple. As Robert wrote in Rich Dad Poor Dad,

> If you do not have a strong reason, there is no sense readint further. It will sound like too much work

If you don’t have the determination and mindset, what you’re gonna read further would not make sense to you, as it just sounds impossibly stupidly simple. But how to change your mindset is a whole other topic that deserves a more serious discussion.

**And again, it’s stupidly simple.**

All you need to do is, get up.

My past self wouldn’t have understood this. I didn’t know better. Once I wanna make the change from within myself, it all makes sense. The twisting fact that, the solution to getting up early is just get up, starts to make sense more and more it gets executed, especially when the idea of ‘submit to discomfort’ is understood.

Submit to discomfort. It works like a charm, regarding getting up early, cold showering, and every tiny little thing in daily life. When something is tough, when you don't wanna do something, just do it. Surrender to it, submit to it, and just do it.

It’s almost like, surrender to the reality, stop resisting, stop adding resistance to the seemingly dreadful tasks. And you bow to reality, make yourself lose, and stop fighting back the inertia. Stop fighting with your reluctance to taking action. Just give up whatever voice in your head that’s fighting and stop trying to not do the thing. Instead, do the thing.

Once it’s done, it feels f-ing great. you ain't losing, you submitted to the discomfort, and whatever that is so discomforting is done, by you. Man, that feels great. You gave up, but you persist at the same time — You gave up fighting back with your rational mind and you gave up hearing the annoying voice in your head, which surprisingly represents the voice of a POS.

And you win. you didn’t fight against your laziness, you didn't fight against the voice in your head that’s comforting you in a soothing tone “it’s too early now, it’s okay to just sleep a bit long, you deserve the extra five minutes”, you didn't fight against the task of getting up early. you just gave up the fight. But you didn't lose. You win. You win by giving up. You win by submitting. You win by ignoring the comforting voice in your head that’s telling you to avoid discomfort instead of submitting to it. It’s ironic how illogical this sounds. but this is the goddamn truth. This, my friend, is how you conquer dreadfully tough tasks, you give up and submit to it; this is how you conquer the voice in your head, you give up and smother it; this is how you win, by giving up the process of fighting back.

The whole idea of “submit to discomfort” comes from Better Ideas on Youtube, which is such an awesome channel with top notch content for someone seeking change in life. I wouldn’t be able to do it justice with my paraphrasing. Since I started applying this technique, it’s been tremendously helpful for breaking inertia and stop procrastination in day to day life. Like when you’re mindlessly scrolling and suddenly you realize “hey I really need to do xxx” but you just can stop scrolling. Not hard to imagine this exact scenario happening every single day, multiple times a day. The only thing you need to do to break the cycle is just submit to whatever you need to do, stop rationalizing, stop thinking you really need to do something instead of scrolling, stop extending the scrolling into next 5 or 3 minutes, stop justifying the mindless scrolling. Just submit to it, just do it. And that’s the thing about inertia, while being static, it’s hard to break the status quo and accumulate the momentum; while the gears start turning, it’s gonna do its magic and the inertia will just keep it running with tiny effort from you to maintain.

**End note**

The reason I am typing this right now is because I woke up 10 minutes earlier today, which buys me some extra time before starting my day. It’s once again completed the behavioral cycle. Waking up 10 min earlier rewards me with some extra time to write the Medium post I’ve been wanted to write. And with this post, if in the future I got caught up in life again and lose faith in getting up early, I could slam this post in my face.

Officially in the 6 AM club now. Being able to settle down at desk a bit earlier and start to pursue one’s pursuit a bit earlier just make one feel good.
