I wanna get a tattoo.   

When this kinda things happen, I wanna get a tattoo, to remember whatever that's happening. Not a crazy tat, not some aesthetic graphics, maybe just a simple handwriting-style one, the design doesn't matter to me.    

To remember whatever that's happening? "To remember it" makes it sound like it's for the future. But the future me won't care. And does preset me want him to remember? Present me hopes he dgaf at all.    

Whatever that's happening is meaningful enough, I guess. A turning point in life without exaggeration. As how a turning point is, it symbolizes chances and hopes, often with loss and sometimes despair, all at the same time.    

In the midst of it all, it's good to admit and acknowledge to myself that I'm anxious, worried, and trying my best to brainwash myself into thinking hopeful.   

To get a tattoo, is to commemorate it, make an artificial battle scar for myself, and in the most optimistic light, to celebrate it. It's less for the future, but more for the present. The idea of marking the battle scar on my body, to show that I've fought and lost, somehow eases me.   

I didn't get one for last time, though. I don't regret not getting one, and wouldn't regret if I did, either. I was helpless, it was a big deal. Despite knowing it wouldn't be after a brief few months, I wasn't letting it go. I hadn't learned how to let go, and didn't wanna let it go. I was making it a bigger deal than it was.   

Does this apply to this time? Am I making it a bigger deal than it is?   

I would go and logically write a list of pros and cons for the imaginary universe where things have gone as wished, and the reality where things didn't go as wished. But that wouldn't hold a meaning. Nor would it alleviate the pain I must go through.   

Before adulthood, it was always no-big-deal for me; I was luckily enough to not have failed any when it wasn't NBD, and I wasn't smart enough to know this back then - "I hadn't failed" isn't probably accurate. More accurate to say I didn't want it as badly, it wasn't as painful, if any, when I failed. At least it's been unchallenging to brush it off and forget about it - and fate and luck were on my side and eventually did wonders.   


Later on in life, there comes times when I desperately wanted something , put in all my energy, and underwent more than necessary anxiety. I tried and failed last year, and I tried and failed again this year. But failure is only an indicator of the destination. This time I did enjoy the journey (not the feeling of desperation) - I tried my best.   

Somehow, after waking up one morning with hopes but only to be welcomed with bad news, I watched a promising future crashed and someone being thrown out into the harsh current of life, confused and anxious. That person is me and future being mine. The magic of life.   

I am still feeling resentful sometimes when negativity gets the good sides of my mind. Despite my best effort in convincing myself that I enjoyed the journey of last 10 months or so, I wanted to reach the destination, desperately. Especially when I look at myself through the lenses of others - this is the culprit isn't it, comparison. I shouldn't have looked at myself through the lenses of others. But solely from my own eyes, I wanna achieve what I set out to achieve. I wanna see the sunshine and roses of *the other side\**.    

When it comes to comparison, not everyone has the level of difficulty in the game of life; some have it easier and others don't, and it's only realistic to acknowledge that.   

But what's even there to compare? I'll be entitled and somewhat narcissist to say that I've lived a different life. Why on earth should I compare myself against others, against those who don't think about how to live a life - They are too bury looking down to even notice life!   

I know the only comparison that matters is comparing myself with myself. And I know it's easier said than done, when I'm surrounding by the said "others", and constantly being evaluated by all those common metrics, both by them and by myself. I wanna remind myself of the absurdity to enslave myself to this kind of unnecessary self-imposed and toxic pressure.   


But ironically, for someone who keeps using "majority" and "them", I do sometimes wish the normie type of peacefulness for myself.   

Sometimes i do wish some aspects of life could be like others - have it safe and planned, and everything actually goes as planned. But I guess everything happens for a reason. I'd look back and see these [dots connect](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/463176-you-can-t-connect-the-dots-looking-forward-you-can-only).    


Not everyone is on a different journey. I'd, again, choose to be entitled and think that I'm on a different journey. I don't watch a movie only to see how it ends.   

I've experienced the ups and downs, and those quarterly [OKRs](https://youtu.be/XAeKtyL2m-Q?si=epF_f6ryAOWfG2Q2&t=118). Soon it'd become a past tense, or it already has. It'd become the tattoo I have, the one that I look at in the mirror and think, "that was hell of an experience".

The situation is unpleasantly similar. I certainly don't enjoy the damage of it on my self-trust and hope. I almost forgot how easy it is to retreat to the corner - feel like settling for less, giving in to the situation and take the easy way out; or worst yet, giving up and throwing everything out of the window.  

When confidence is out of the window, I'm forced to look into the uncomfortable. As I've always been subconsciously aware, and only recently acknowledge, I am constantly seeking validation from others. To go through another phase of proving myself worthy and evaluating myself with a number, isn't what I like to experience.   


One thing that's different, though, is bottles of alcohol will be spared. The person going through it has learned life is in the control of his own hands.    


Almost a year - I aim to achieve that external goal, and I'm also motivated to achieve the tiny but incremental betterment of myself. This, at the end of the day, is yet again just another lesson to learn, another aspect of life to experience, another new chapter of life to live, another chance for new adventures, another set of closing window and opening doors.
