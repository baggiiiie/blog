"It's gonna be Christmas soon, and New Year, and everyone'd be posting about trips and how wonderful their lives are."

"Delete instagram then."

We exchanged some glances and some indescribable facial expressions as if acknowledging the fact that I just said something insane, almost insane, yet not so much insane. I mean, isn't it completely possible?

"It's not that hard." I continued.

Before he could come up with something, I'd already taken out my phone, scrolled to that specific page on the home screen, perfectly located my index finger on the app, all done with a jarring amount of proficiency thanks to muscle memory. The part not included in the series of muscle memory, though, was pressing down the app and shifting my finger towards the x on the corner, going straight for the red bold text, despite its desperate shaking and twerking. Instead of clicking on the app and starting a who-knows-how-long scrolling session and mental battle, it's something different this time.



And that's how it got started, not a grand ceremony with some grand New Year resolutions. It's fairly casual instead, from a random topic that popped up over dinner table. I have thought about this before, but there seemed to be no reason to eliminate social media out of my life. Although I had my own motive, without a trigger like this, I'd still be on Instagram for hours a day.

Social media sucks a lot of time, which is not even the evil part of it. It slowly eats you up, by turning you into a brainless zombie. No stimulant is as accessible as it.

Every morning when I walk to work, my route goes against the exit of metro. Every single morning I see people walking with their eyes locked on their phones and earphones plugged in. they walk straight towards anyone and anything that's in front of them, without any awareness of the fact that they are walking on a street. Sometimes when I have a glance at their screens, it's TikTok or Instagram or YouTube, of course. Without even glancing, I'd guess it's probably these apps that are so important that they can't take their eyes off. And to me, they are just walking, a brainless zombie.

For some reason this has been unmorally normalized. What's crazy is that, even in office, people walk around with phones. I am also lucky enough to witness that people would take a break from looking at their laptop, proceed to take out and unlock their phones, stand up and walk to the bathroom, all while holding and staring at their phone. In the bathroom, they'd unzip and retrieve and relieve themselves, and yes, ALL WHILE HOLDING THEIR DAMN PHOENS. Sounds too extreme? Yeah, I thought that *was* extreme until seeing 5 guys on the urinal were doing the exact thing. I believe (more like hope, actually) this extreme doesn't apply to the majority of humanity. But certainly people are sitting on the loo staring at their phones; waiting in line staring at their phones; waiting for bus staring at their phones; waiting for elevator staring at their phones. First thing after finishing a 2-hour study sesh? Checking phones; First thing after waking up? Checking phones; Last thing before going to bed? Checking phones. What's so interesting on the phone that they gotta be checking? Social media, which is not really that interesting, but it keeps your brain stimulated after all.

The need to be constantly stimulated, it's an impulse that they can't control. Think it's controllable? Try to wait in line for 15 minutes without checking your phone and see how impossible that it.

What's so bad about it, isn't that what phones are for? Isn't that how technology benefits us - killing boredom? There are probably loads of research done on why this impulsive behavior is turning you into a brainless zombie. The discussion would deserve a separate post with more scientific supports, instead of some mere observations and rants. 


Though the tone, the usage of "they" and "you" do make me sound condescending, I *suffered* from this, I suffered from the need to be constantly stimulated, and suffered from the instant availability of social media, without realizing it's actually suffering. Another aspect that I might have suffered more is, social media that focuses on exchanging posts and likes (Instagram that is) turns one into an attention-seeking whore, especially so when he care too much about someone's, or everyone's, opinions of him.


So you posted a well-crafted new post, or a seemingly casual but in fact well-crafted story, what's gonna happen in the next few hours to few days is that you'd be constantly checking whether tens or hundreds or even thousands of your acquaintances have seen whatever it is that you posted (What kind of evil feature that is to see who has viewed your story?) Maybe you just enjoy seeing how many people have liked your posts, even though you know it takes exactly 300ms for them to accidentally land on your posts and like it out of courtesy. And, hopefully, you wouldn't really use the word "enjoyable" to describe seeing the like counts at a high. But it certainly disappoints when the number is a low. (Posted 3 days ago and there's like 4 likes? wtf??)

Or maybe you don't want that much attention from an indifferent crowd, there's a special someone that you care so much that you've developed this chronic ailment of attempting to get attention from them. Days perfectly ruined if the one name you're looking for didn't appear in the list. That person most likely happens to be the one with the profile which you slip in for the 20th time today.

Whatever it is, whatever the reason is, you're just craving attention and seeking validation from someone else - someone who you give too much fuck about and who might not give the tiniest fuck about what you're posting or what you're doing with your life.

This is when social media really takes a toll on mental health. To get attention and validation from an uninterested and uninteresting crowd; or to stalk the special someone.


Social media isn't completely trash though. Building a social portfolio is one of the most beneficial advantages of it. That's how I treated it, at least at the very beginning. Build a social portfolio, it comes in handy when you're a freshman trying to socialize. It shows the un-boring bits of your life, which implicitly shows the interestingness of you. Hey, just like LinkedIn, but for normal socializing instead of benefit-driven networking. And I mean, do give people a place to stalk you, take it as an honor and make your stalker's life easier. On that note, occasionally(very) when you do slide into someone's DMs or yours getting slid into, you get something good out of social media.

And I do miss the social aspects of social media. But the benefit it offers is, unfortunately, too significantly disproportional to the time I spend on it. It's crazy to think, for the past 5 years, I have been on it non-stop. At least 1 hour a day on average, and that's the very very least. Which probably consists of more than 30 times of brainless clicking on it. 1 beer a day for 5 years straight sounds way too fucked up than 1 hour of Instagram for 5 years straight, which is why it's easier to acknowledge drinking 1 beer a day is an addiction. It's fairly uncommon to hear someone acknowledging they are addicted to social media and treating it as one, while it definitely is when people are doing it impulsively, multiple times a day, allowing their brain to be drifting in the stimulation and escapism, so they can escape boredom, escape problem, and simply not think.


I'm criticizing it like I'm not one of them, but i still haven't given up on social media completely. I haven't eliminated it for the exact reasons mentioned above: I still crave for this kind of fake connection, empty attention and meaningless validation, sadly. But I do consider myself lucky enough to realize this and actually take actions to pull myself out. Although I still check it at least once a day, the aversion to mindless scrolling has effectively decreased my time on Instagram, which, to me, means that my overall screen time has gone down drastically.

And I haven't figured out what to do with the time it frees from not using Instagram. When waiting in lines or standing in elevators, I've had no trouble to just people watching. But after finishing 2 hours of high intensity work, I just wanna chill and get some cheap and fast dopamine, for like 5 minutes. I know I could probably walk around or stretch or other alternatives, but that feels like a perfect time for instagram, doesn't it? 

I'd go on and write about the mental space it frees up, besides time. But currently I'm not able to put it into words just yet, though I do feel the significance. It's a topic that needs to be revisited after more insights have fluxed in, after I have more experience with this digital abstinence.

And some random notes:
As the title suggests, the draft started slightly after Christmas, and now it's March. Through January, I was on a more rigid schedule with social media - only checking it once a week. It's gotten a bit more frequent after mid Feb, as mentioned above, a few times a day, mostly to reply messages, and only after 8pm. Time-wise it has little impact to my schedule, but it really clutters the mind. When I went completely cold turkey in Jan, I didn't even have the thought of checking Instagram after the first few days of withdrawal. But now, from time to time, when it's the break for a 2-hour high intensity work sesh, I'd be feeling like checking Instagram.

While editing this piece of writing almost 2 months after it was firstly started, the writing style feels like nothing similar to what I'd write. Lori Gottlieb is showing her influence through the lines. *Maybe You Should Talk To Someone* - It was a fun book. I enjoyed it a lot.
