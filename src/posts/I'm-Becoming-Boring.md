Life is thrilling, full of wild experiences, 'cause YOLO, right? All the crazy stupid things you can do, the cool stories you can tell. I mean, life is fun, it's breath-taking-tranquil-scenery kinda fun; it's I-might-have-drank-too-much kinda fun; it's this-edible-ain't-shit kinda fun. 

That's me two years ago, when I was having exactly the above-mentioned kinda fun in a country located in northern Europe what happened to crown the title of "happiest country in the world" 6 years in a row. Boring is the furthest from the life back then. What's even there to bore yourself with? Like, don't be a loser sitting at home. Go out and have fun. Be adventurous, be interesting, be shitfaced, be something, be anything, don't be boring.

But man I have changed, in a way I'd never expected. Now I'm writing this, as a pre-sleep routine, in bed at 10:30PM. I am, not gonna lie, pretty happy with the amount of boringness that my life is filled with right now.

Every morning, I wake up at around the same time and do the same thing; then walk to work and do the same thing; subsequently walk the same way back home and do the same thing. Even just writing all these down feels boring. That's the most boring cycle that I'd dread to even think about. I'd tell myself "Dude get a life". Well, dude, I've got a life, that's my life, a boring one, the one that I'd hate.

It did take me a while to wrap my head around the whole concept of "living a boring life". After all the fun I'd had, the pleasure-pain balance got tipped over so bad, my brain chemistry was severely fucked, I was therefore severely fucked, unable to re-integrate back to a normal life, a life that's not filled with fun - by fun, at this point, it's really only those balance-tilting, dopamine-stimulating activities.


I'd be constantly seeking ways to pull the pleasure lever. Drinking for sure, that's one way I've gone down. And even other less harmful-sounding behaviors, like, i'd be sitting at home, trying to get some work done, and got distracted 3 minutes in, thinking about what to eat for dinner, or even just go out and walk around the campus. I can't let the seesaw tip to the pain side, I can't let boringness take over. I mean, being bored is boring.

I'd like to call it maturity or even wisdom, to acknowledge that life itself is boring. The essence of life is boredom. There are excitement and fun and all, but the extremely fun part, say, picture the most fun thing you wanna do now, happens like 3 times or less, if it'd happen at all; other crazy trips and the like, is maybe 2% of life if you ball hard enough; decently fun part, say doing stupid shit drunk with mates, is 5% of life, which already makes me sound like a drunkard. The rest? The boring bits. Even when i was living the most im-boring(?) life I've ever lived, 80% of it was not defined as fun in any dictionary. It was a boring self-repeating loop - eat the same cereals, do the same squat, and majority of it was scrolling Instagram, watching YouTube, and binging on Netflix. Not exactly the fun I imagined myself would be having in Europe, was it?

Yet for one year, if not more, I've been trying to make my day to day life fun and exciting. After struggles and breakdowns and scribbles on diary and non-sensible self-talking, I have finally learned the art of living a boring life; it happens to be the time when I learned the beauty of having a definite purpose. Don't think I am qualified enough to talk or write about it yet, but with loads of realization hits all at once, ambition goes up, addiction goes down, connection with family builds - I actually wanna do something more meaningful, I actually realized that I should try, and actually took the first step of trying. It becomes stupidly easy to see, if you wanna achieve something, you gotta do this "something" over and over again, which, inevitably, makes it less fun, and even boring. Fair to say the ones who enjoy their "something" more and more and more, they are God's chosen ones.


Anyways, there's always the boring aspect of everything. I used to think, and still think that, living life as a YouTuber is fun - sharing whatever you're interested in is fun, but editing might not be fun, marketing might not be fun, posting content just for traffic might not be fun, trying to get monetized might not be fun. You should probably be enjoying every single step of the job if you wanna be a YouTuber, but we all know that's complete BS. For everything fun, there's always some less-fun or not-fun-at-all process involved.


Also, another new perspective of this from Mark Manson is:
 > When you're pursuing a wide breadth of experience, there are diminishing returns to each new adventure, each new person or thing.
 > ...
 > pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience. There are some experiences that you can have only when you've lived in the same place for five years, when you've been with the same person for over a decade, when you've been working on the same skill or craft for half your lifetime.

Tldr: fun only becomes less and less fun; boring, counter-intuitively, becomes more and more fun. Sadly, that's how human brain is wired in the first place, that's how nature works - you're not supposed to have that much fun, when you do, whatever is fun before becomes normal, and eventually, not fun at all.


The boring life I'm living right now has more depth to it (at least I would like to think so, ffs imagine if it's not..). Im not just chasing breadth without depth like I used to. Instead of learning guitar for one week and base the next, I would like to have a focus on guitar now. And you know what, I'm learning neither of them, 'cause I need to do the subtraction even more, narrow down to what's already in my life to pursue the depth. Doing the subtraction, though, is hard. Harder than I thought. Becoming a boring person is hard. Saying no to new experiences is hard. But one thing I know for sure, being the version of myself that I hate is hardest of all.
