lol this title sounds unnecessarily scary.

It’s a Sat afternoon after my vulnerable sleeping schedule got disrupted by my thoughts last night, which leads to me sitting in my room, brainlessly, not able to do anything productive. Just wanna write about not being able to fall asleep due to my brain just going on fire mode with all kinda thoughts when I lie down in bed.

I have always suffered from this, maybe categorized as some sort of insomnia, since young. Back in secondary school, I would lie in bed doing nothing and couldn't sleep. It wasn’t because I was scrolling and let my phone take away the sleepiness. At that time scrolling wasn’t even a thing, as internet wasn’t so well developed yet, not that much stuff to scroll in the first place; and phones weren’t that good yet ’cause it was a time when a lot of the phones hadn’t got smart; and phone usage were limited in school. Counting sheep sometimes worked, sometimes failed, as I could count to thousands while still being awake, or get frustrated when I lost count at a very high number.

In high school when scrolling becomes more common, I would just get up and scroll if I couldn't fall asleep. I remember I used to read and learn languages on phones before sleep. Consistently getting blue light every day before bed but didn't feel like I suffered from insomnia that badly back in high school. Maybe my sleep was better. Or maybe I still had bad sleeps but just didn’t get frustrated when I couldn’t sleep ’cause I could just scroll.

when it comes to uni it’s probably become worse. There are times when I just lie in bed for hours, and my mind is just firing thoughts. This happens on and off till now, I have not found out what might be the cause. Don’t think it’s stress. Oftentimes the thoughts could be positive stuff, could be inspirational, could be some jokes that my brain suddenly pulls off at 2AM, could be something dug out from past memories, could be some extra creative stuff. And of course, could be stress and worries and anxieties. Personally feel like the negatives are not so common.

Sometimes it’s just because I learn about something new a bit before bed time and when I'm lying in bed my brain just keeps thinking about it. (yes, that’s my own fault for poor bed time management and not following through a night time pre-sleep routine and getting stimulated with too much information) Like sometimes I would literally think of something that’s so interesting / motivational / innovative / philosophical / insert other positive adjectives that I can’t fall asleep.

It’s probably cuz my brain ain’t tired. If my brain does loads of heavy lifting during the day or before sleep, I tend to fall asleep faster and sleep tighter. Well, at the same time I also do feel that sometimes even when my brain is hella tired, it still keeps going.

No matter what, the root cause is not ambiguous: I’m losing my mind. Well that really comes off as some sociopath. Okay fine, the root cause, I think, is, I can’t control my thoughts, I can’t control my mind, all them thoughts are depriving my inner peace, and as a result, my sleep. That’s when I think of meditation.

I used to meditate daily during 2020, thanks to covid (no irony), cuz I was just hella bored and always wanted to try it and suddenly i have a lot of time to explore. I wouldn't say I’d gained some life-changing benefits from it at that time, with daily practices for at least 2 months. But I could definitely see some improvement with consistency, and that’s when I first grasped the idea of the mysterious “control your mind, observe your thoughts” kinda stuff. And I got better with it. It was a great experience, but wasn’t great enough for me to integrate it into my life after covid. I still do it from time to time, but most of the time for the sake of calming myself and that didn't happen very often.

I'm back to the state of struggling with sleep for a few days, or maybe even a week now. It’s like a fight every time. I’m fighting against my brain. I’d very much like to sleep and prevent whatever is going on from ruining my day. After some 30 minutes to 1 hour tries, I would just give up and do something, which inevitably ruined the next day.

Honestly, sometimes when I have been struggling for a few day, I would even get some wonky feelings when it’s time to sleep. I wouldn't say stress, but I do get, erm, superstitious about it, like becoming super conscious of my activities before sleep, to make sure the falling asleep experience is smooth. I for one know that this is just gonna accomplish the opposite. Setting up a regular night time routine definitely works, but it reaches a point where I am almost walking on thin ice.

Wonder how common is whatever this is. How many people are facing the same issue. Not many among my friend circle. And people often just say, try not to think so much when you wanna sleep. But like, how? How do you NOT think? How do you not let your brain function when it really wants to? In my opinion, whatever it is that I’m describing, is beyond the control of my will.

I wanna use meditation as some solution to my sleep problem. It definitely is. The calming effect has the most direct influence, and has worked for many times. It also addresses the ultimate issue, which is helping me to acquire the ability to control my mind.

I don't even know what “control one’s mind” means. Like, if you can “control your mind”, would you be able to just switch your brain off and have inner peace on demand? That sounds amazing to me, man, sounds too good to be true. I have been benefited from the calming effects of meditation, and how it regulates moods and whatnot. But I’m not a moody person and I’m not in any particular mood when my brain starts running at an incomprehensible speed while at an unreasonable hour. There are times when I am in mood, but more often than not, I'm just lying there, thinking, better wording is, letting my brain runs. Would it be even possible to just be like “hey buddy time to sleep” and stop all the thoughts from being launched in my mental space so I can just sleep?

Well, I guess there’s only one way to find out. Needless to reiterate the benefits of meditating daily. It’s not anything challenging, either. I’ve done it before and I don’t see any obstacles if I wanna do it again. With that said, it’s time to integrate it back to my life, in order to, first of all, improve my sleep, and ultimately, control my mind.
