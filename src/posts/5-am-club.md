I have been reading this book on and off for about a week or two now.

Currently half way through Chapter 4. When I first started, the book seemed weird. Starting with some speaker suddenly collapses and dies during a speech? …and three weirdos not doing anything about it…? I am not even sure if I read it correctly, and I was so unsure whether I was reading the right book or not. I went on to Youtube and whatnot trying to find some summary of the book and tried to figure out what’s going on with the book.

The summaries doesn’t help much. I was still confused about the book but I decided to stick through and just read it and see what’s up with the book.

Now I’m in Chapter 4. This book feels pretty much like a compilation of all them good quotes, which probably makes it a feel-good book. It’s getting interesting now. A storytelling process. And the weirdos are sharing some personal experience that are more relatable, e.g., the entrepreneur is saying she has to fire employees because they fail to grow and continue to provide value as her company evolves; and the artist says something about not being able to stop using phones. One quote here goes like ‘Many people just watch TV endlessly, not realizing it’s eroding their imagination as well as bankrupting their bank account.’

That’s exactly how I feel about mindless scrolling on social media. It’s eroding our personality, our ability to think, and as the quote suggests, our bank accounts. With mindless scrolling, the brain has gone idle. Mindless, like a zombie just keeps going. Or a moth not knowing why but just cant stop rushing to the fire.

Later in the book the author does use the word zombie to describe such phenomenon: cyber zombies.

> It’s like they’re not real human beings anymore. More like robots, glued to their screens. Not present. And half-alive to life.

I mean, literally, look around your house, your work environment, and any other possible locations, they’re filled with people who are complaining about life, yet the best they can make use of their time is scrolling mindlessly. This, just scares the hell outta me. I have been one of them, and one simple comment from Youtube or somewhere has just hit me the right spot: it’s hard to achieve a desirable physique, but it’s harder to be staying out of shape and dreaming about achieving the physique. In other words, it’s hard to be a winner, but it’s way harder to be the loser you hate.

Yeah, that’s what this book has brought to me so far. All these good quotes. Some inspiring ones, some witty ones. (I’m not ant-social. I’m just anti-moron.)

This can’t just be a feel-good book, right? Well, I don’t have much knowledge about this book other than its title appearing in various Youtube videos. I guess it’s worth reading?

Will it be such an enlightenment that’ll motivate people to change themselves? Or will it provide some tangible methodologies like Atomic Habits? No clue to tell right now. But it’s getting interesting anyway. Worth the read so far.

### 21 Sept
Another 10 days with reading this book. Currently approaching the 50% mark. Still, most of the book feels like a good compilation of quotes and philosophy, and hard truth to swallow.

> … many have an entitlement mentality, expecting a rich productive and fulfilling life to just show up one day like a sparrow at the beginning of spring.

Quotes like this that actually resonate with me. Sometimes it does get real personal lol which is inspiring and personal enough for the tiny bits in people that want to make a change to kindle.

And every chapter just straight away starts with a quote like:

> A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It’s only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. — Steven Pressfield

It becomes hard to see the difference between all these quotes and a random motivational videos on YouTube. What else more does it have to offer?

My answer to this question, as of right now, is, this book offers a lot more teaching other than the motivating parts. It is a feel-good book filled with all these quotes and making everyone think they are capable of achieving anything. It is also MORE than a feel-good book as it does points out the BS everyone’s feeding themselves and offers some hard truth to take in. It’s changing people from within, for people to want to make a change.

> A bad day for the ego is a great day for the soul.

Looking at my notes, it’s got on all them good quotes tagged and underlined.

And then we have some characters in the book. The artist and the entrepreneur serve the purpose of being relatable to readers and introduce their perspectives, which is the perspective of a normal everyday human being into the story. Which is definitely good on this aspect, like rich dad and poor dad and Mike. But this book got its own touch.

At this point, I am completely confused on why there is a need for the drama to go on between these two. It’s already a bizarre beginning for the book, which is a book about self improvement. And then the island adventure, which is not weird with the weird beginning paving the way. But now these two just met and got into some romantic drama. No none of that thanks. Not a fan.

>The entrepreneur looked over to the artist. “Until now.”
>
>Tears filled his eyes.
>…
>
>The entrepreneur smiled and then proceeded to respond in a gentle tone. “ I hope I never lose you.”

This is too much, man. Like the trashy sci-fi covered rom-com I just read.

But yea, what more, what else more does this book have to offer. Only half way yet, I am still hoping and believing there’s something more to extract from it other than quotes and the uncalled for drama.

### 6 Oct
The book is finished on 1 Oct. Finally managed to squeeze some time to continue with this post.

I truly am ashamed when using the word ‘squeeze’, not like I’m super busy but also, truthfully, I haven’t been not busy lately, either. And as I was justing going through the notes I have in the book, this line just caught my eyes.

> There’s a staggering difference between being busy and being productive.

Well, I’d like to think that I’m somewhat productive, and I might need to give myself a bit more credit on this. I have indeed been way more busy and way more productive than I have been. At the same time, I do feel it’s not productive enough. The underlying causes of this thinking might be just because there’s too much to catch up with, which I think plays a huge part. Another potential cause is loss of direction. But there’s no doubt that there’s always room for improvement. I have been tracking every minute of my day, (which will be documented in another post, which has already been drafted and left unfinished, which hopefully soon will be posted), and it’s definitely a good way to reflect on my productivity. But it’s not all of the metrics.

As someone who has been procrastinating life for years, being busy is cool, is good. I’m fine with being busy. Matter of fact, I wanna be busy. But since young, I just hate the idea of [leading a busy life and failing to achieve anything meaningful](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A2%8C%E7%A2%8C%E6%97%A0%E4%B8%BA). To me that’s hella scary. And the lack of direction isn’t really a positive factor in this equation. But at this period of life, I know better now. The cost of inaction scares me even more. Taking some actions, which might not lead to the “meaningful results”, is better than taking no action. And maybe just bear an experience-oriented mindset towards life I guess.

And another quote that leads back to topic of mindless scrolling:

>…Other avoidance tactics from the pain of potential unexpressed are hours mindlessly surfing online, electronic shopping, working too much, drinking too much, eating too much, complaining too much and sleeping too much.
>
>Filling valuable hours with meaningless moves if the drug of choice for most people.

These are all escapism, avoidance of pain, which potentially causes more pain in the long run. Only potentially, as if people might just never come to the realization that, the cause of their misfortunes — which will only be recognized as misfortunes, a word that already directs the blame to luck or fate or whatever they’d call — would only be external. Not trying to negate the possibility of misfortunate events happening in life. In fact, I believe too many people are suffering from tremendous misfortunes that I couldn’t imagine. But it’s not hard to see that, most of the “misfortunes” are simple not misfortunes. They are destiny of internal issues more often than not.

We victimize ourselves. Maybe I’m over qualifying myself by saying “we”. But we just make excuses and then recite them so many times we train our subconscious mind to think they are true. We blame life and outer conditions for our struggles, and we condemn past events for our private wars.

Writing all these down, I am simply so glad that I have become able to realize this.

> Within this personal ecosystem the majority of us create for ourselves, mediocrity then becomes acceptable…
> 
> We resign ourselves to average.

Powerful words.

The entrepreneur asks “what if I only want to do this five days a week and take weekends off?” The response is “It’s your life. Do what fits you best and feels right to you.” and also “Yet also know that part-time commitment truly does deliver part-time results.”

It’s actually quite enjoyable to wake up early every morning for not having rush for work or school or anything. If weekends are reserved for parties and friends and all, sure, that’s part of life that shouldn’t be sacrificed. But once it gets ingrained in daily routine, you WILL wanna do it daily, as you’re capable of it and you know well that it’s beneficial. I mean, it’s fulfilling the reward part of the cycle(cue, trigger, action, reward). It’s gonna make you feel good.

And also, it’s just not practical in some situations. Humans are social animals. Waking at this hour every day has its own impact on one’s social life. It’s not hard to see that waking at 5 indicates sleep at 10pm or even earlier, waking at 6 would simply has less impact on this aspect as compared to 5. And you pick your own social circle anyway. If your social circle if filled with partying people, I don’t see any practicality of waking at 5 at all.

>Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.

No doubt these words are truth. However, sometimes it’s mad hard to tell whether you’re the great spirits or just a straight up cocky bohemian. The confidence of being able to ‘refuse to bow blindly to conventional prejudices’ almost sounds the opposite of humility sometimes. How can one be so sure that he’s not belonging to the majority, or mediocrity? I am not saying this as a rhetorical question, it’s actually a sincere inquiry. How does one have the confidence to go against the conventional? How does one not have the self doubt? It’s kinda result-oriented isn’t it? If one sticks through and succeeds, it’s called persistence and he’s found a spot outside of mediocrity for himself; if it goes the other way, he’s just cocky and stubborn and remains mediocrity. I fully understand that this should not discourage anyone from trying to be the best of themselves and be distinguished from a mediocre crowd. But, again, how to have the confidence, and how to stay so confident?

>You don’t have the brain you want, you have the brain you’ve earned. Or to put it another way, you don’t have the brain you desire, you have the brain you deserve.

Nothing much to share about this one, it’s like a wake-up call from time to time. To keep myself motivated and discipline to pursue information. Sounds weird to say ‘pursue information’ instead of ‘knowledge’, but it sounds less like a cliche I guess. And really just the idea that, you don’t owe anything, and you’re not owed anything. Most of the time, you earn what you have, you deserve what you have. Hard to swallow pill it is. Another quote in the book does the idea justice:

>Poverty is the consequence of an inner condition, not an outer situation.

And speaking of ‘deserve’, however you live your life, you live it for yourself. You excel for your family and loved ones, and remember you excel for yourself. You deserved to experience your greatness.

One of the ‘tactics of lifelong genius’ in the book is to ‘lock two ninety-minute massages onto your weekly schedule’. I personally don’t see anyone with a 9 to 5 has the time or the mindset os the extra cash to do this. And as further explained in the book:

>You might say you’re a busy performer and can’t aford the time to get two long massages every single week. In fact, given the proven and marvelous benefits of thes protocol for your mental state, cognition, joyfulness, health and longevity, the truth is you can’t afford not to install this habit. Yes, two ninety-minute massages a week will cost a lot of money. Death will cost you more.

I still hold my doubts. But I’m 100% on board with the idea of ACTUALLY prioritizing some activities no matter what. Make them your non-negotiable, either in terms of time or money. One easy example to see is gym, working out. But some others are just too easy to ignore, like actually putting time and effort into building up financial knowledge, a financial portfolio.

This Medium post has been dragged for way too long, it’s become messy and unreadable. It’s really just me typing down my thoughts while reading the book. Maybe I’ll wrap it up here. And one last quote from the book for the darker days:

>… if that which I wish for does not come, it’s simply because something even better is on its way.
