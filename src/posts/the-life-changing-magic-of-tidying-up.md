### Pre-reading

Before reading, the idea I have of the book is that, it teaches you how to tidy up your space, which is a very essential skill, and a skill I particularly like. I am by no means an untidy person, being a critic of my own. But still, I tidy up once a while and it gets messy real quick. I do have a good habit of putting things back to their original places. but still, after a few days of a cleanup, books are lying around, desk is unorganized again.

I have never underestimated the impact, both positive and negative, that environment has on us. Talking about the literal physical space that our body and mind stay in. House, room, desk, bed, everything.

Once, i went to a room, and saw clothes piled up on the chair. They are the dirty ones. The clean ones pile up in bed. As there’s only one chair in the room, the owner has to do work in bed. Soon, sitting becomes lying, become napping. I was just thinking, "damn, a hanging rack would save your productivity so much." Yet they fail to see it. Just one positive addition to the physical space, they would probably be able to sit and work on the desk properly, in a way that wouldn’t escalate to napping.

And I know pretty damn well that I like to keep things, for the sake of memory. And I think throwing stuff away is just not a virtue, but I am also not willing to put in the effort of putting my old clothes into a recycling station. Hence, my closet, drawers, and every storage space, is filled with old stuff, the stuff that used to have meaning, or never ever have any meaning, that I don’t wanna throw away just yet.

I know some saying that goes like "only keep the stuff that bring you joy". It might be from this book, we’ll find out.

### Introduction

Just finished the introduction, where it builds up all the expectations. and unexpectedly, i came to learn about being organized with my stuff, but it seems to be offering something a bit more, which just overturned my pre-conceived perception of this book. The following is sort of a testimony included in the book:
> You course taught me to see what I really need and what I don’t. So I got a divorce.

Yeah, being messy in your physical space is essentially a reflection of a messy mind. Not hard to see that you have to change the mindset first, if you wanna make any long term significant change. This applies to all aspects of life. Without changing one’s mind, nothing’s gonna really change other than the superficials. I’ve always believed that, if a poor person wins any crazy amount of lottery, let’s say 10 mil, they would still be poor, as they haven’t had the mindset of the rich, nor the skillset. Maybe some would argue, "how is it possible that you own 10 mil and still be poor, you are literally the definition of being rich". But just imagine, if an unorganized person goes and live in an organized living space that’s not organized by them, can u guarantee that the space would stay organized after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month? No, the place would become a messy in no time. Even if there’s a perfect storage system, or a perfect cleaning machine. None would do.

And also the idea that’s being promoted by the book.

> You can’t tidy if you’ve never learned how

That is madly true. I have always been looking at life with information-seeking mindset. People buy stocks and invest and etc without even having any prior knowledge. They might have watched a YouTube video, talked to some consultant, read some book, and hoped to obtain any monetary gain from their first investment. If they do, that’s probably just beginner’s luck; if they don’t, the only gain is a hard learned lesson, which is definitely more rewarding than the beginner’s luck if it’s a lesson learned properly. It’s unbelievably bizarre that we have not been taught on the topic of financial literacy throughout current schooling system. It’s even crazier to realize that we have never ever been taught how to tidy up in the entire life. Every subject has its own inherent unique methodology and knowledge to master. The same goes for tidying up. I mean, everyone has their own way to get about this matter, from their own experience of trials and errors in life. But why not just learn an effective, proven, and widely adopted system that someone else has created for you? The trials and errors you have gone through, might not be necessarily the one that works the best, right? "Oh I come up with my own tidying routines, they fit me". If you are happy with the status quo, fantastic; if not, chances are, they don’t fit you. Instead, you fit them, you’re used to them.

Not to further digress the topic, but just wanna point out that, I do think this applies to everything in life. If you’re happy with the status quo, fantastic; if not, change. More importantly, **learn**, learn how to change for the better.

### Some Mental Prep

> When you tidy your space completely, you transform the scenery. The change is so profound that you feel as if you are living in a totally different world. This deeply affects your mind and inspires a strong aversion to reverting to your previously cluttered state.

Here the author is talking about why her method works without rebound. I quoted it because the word "aversion" is just the right word to be used here. As talked about in Atomic Habits, an impactful change comes from the change of self perception, from the change of how one identifies oneself. Once you make the identity change, you evaluate yourself with different metrics. From my own personal experience, this is so true when it comes to gym. Once you identify yourself as a regular gym goer, it just become so easy to follow through. You wouldn’t wanna revert back to your old self. As someone who has been physically active, I can’t imagine going back to the life without working out. I would have this kind of aversion, I would literally HATE myself if I stop engaging in any form of sports that break a sweat. That’s a huge emotional factor there, which is also a topic mentioned in Rich Dad Poor Dad. Humans are emotion-driven. Yes it’s good to be rational and all. But at the end of the day, being emotion-driven is one of our characteristics. Instead of trying to bury that only nature trait, we can use it to our advantages as well. This is also touched upon in the later part of the book:

> When it comes to selecting what to discard, it is actually our rational judgment that causes trouble. Although intuitively we know that an object has no attraction for us, our reason raises all kinds of arguments for not discarding it, such as "I might need it later" or "It’s a waste to get rid of it."

This is fairly similar to the idea of submitting to discomfort. The gists in them are: your rational mind is justifying some actions that are probably not good for you, to make you feel better for taking the easy way out. It’s the same as "I didn’t sleep well last night", "It’s a Saturday I deserve this". Your inner voice is just comforting you by inviting you back to comfort zone. If you really need that sleep, I don’t think your inner voice would even try to justify it. I mean, this inner voice is trying to soothe the uneasiness that tangled around your brows. If the extra "ten minutes" of sleep is really needed, I don’t think there would be any uneasiness for doing so, hence, the inner voice wouldn’t even come out in the first place.

Also as another mental prep, a good amount of effort is spent on promoting the simplicity and effectiveness of this "KonMari" method and how it’s done "once and for all". It’s also pointed out that "quickly" means about half a year. This is probably a bit far from people’s perception of "once and for all". But it’s only six months of one’s entire life. It takes time for any change to happen, gotta put in the time to master something, or to master anything. No quick shortcut. Not your usually get-rich-quick scheme.

### Discarding

As being promoted in the book, only keep the stuff that sparks joy. While discarding those that don’t, the obstacles are obvious: rational minds trying to justify the reason for keeping them, emotion thoughts of not being able to let go. Imagine a piece of clothing that you lost interest in after the purchase while it’s still relatively new, discarding such items feels like a waste cuz they haven’t fulfilled their mission of being worn threadbare.

> "Thank you for giving me joy when I bought you," or "Thank you for teaching me what doesn’t suit me," and let it go.

This is some alpha move, and probably the only move. You don’t like them, you are not gonna wear them, their purpose of existence is not being worn to thin threads. Their purpose is to teach you something about your own self.

This is exceptionally true for books. "I’ll read it some time", some time means never. If you really wanna read the book, you’ll read it. If in the future you regret throwing the book and wanna read it, you’ll buy it and read it. I mean, there is a ton of way to get your hands on a book you wanna read, whether you wanna read it, whether you might read it, is a different question from whether you should let it become a part of the mess in your room.

Another even better, even more relatable situation is YouTube watch later. I just hate myself for adding a ton of videos that I’ll never watch. Don’t get me wrong, I added them into watch later because when I saw them on the front page, I genuinely wanted to watch them. But as one can imagine, most of the watch-laters become watch-nevers. The moment you first encounter a book, a video, is the time to consume them. "It doesn’t hurt if I just put them in the list". Nope, it hurts. You’re definitely less likely to go through something when there’s a thousand of them.

> To avoid missing that moment (the moment to read a particular book), I recommend that you keep your collection small.

### Having Less

> Am I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future?
>
> … As you do so, you’ll begin to see a pattern in your ownership of things.

A byproduct (which might be more meaningful than an organized environment) from tidying up is this. If you put each and every of your items in your hands and discard the ones that don’t spark joy, the rest remained are the ones that reflect you the best. Maybe just some personal preference things like "Oh I never thought I like this color that much", or some characteristic flaws like "Oh I never thought I hold on to my past so much", or you just hate yourself a bit more like "Oh I wanted to learn xxx so much and I just gave up again". Well that’s probably gone too far.

But just imagine, by having less, you have your life easier cuz you might actually get stuff done that way. Like the YouTube example above, if there’s less videos in the list, you’re more likely to go through them. If there are less things stuffed in the closets, you’re more likely to find the ones you’re trying to find. If you have thrown the stuff you’re finding away? Don’t get ahead of yourself, if that happens, that means the thing is replaceable and you’ll find a way to get another one.

> Instead of suffering from the stress of looking and not finding, we take action.

This is very true, too. It’s way more stressful to find some tools in a collection of "useful stuff that might be used later", than take some other action to go about this situation.

### Some Others

> Selecting and discarding one’s possessions is a continuous process of making decisions based on one’s own values. Discarding hones one’s decision-making skills.

I do believe by practicing the simple act of selecting and discarding personal belongings has this magical effects. As discussed above, you learn about yourself while doing so. Your brain makes uses of that information. You reflect on yourself. You get inspired. And you might get a divorce because you now see what you need, what you enjoy and what you don’t.

And with the act of tidying up, you get a more organized environment. As one declutters his environment, or by doing anything thatos bringing positivity in life, he’s creating a more positive environment for himself, and as a result, he would have a more positive attitude towards life, he feels more joy by being positive.

And, human minds is powerful. The psychological effect, and the mood boost with its effects on hormones, would definitely be shown in one’s body and life.

### End Note

In my opinion, this book is gonna be so beneficial to a lot of people, even more beneficial, or with better wording, its potential of being beneficial is significantly greater than some other self-improvement books because of its relevance to everyone. It’s a lot easier for books on this topic to reach generic demographics than a book on, let’s say, finance or some seemingly boring personal development topic. It’s not a feel good book, it’s not about big and vague ideologies on following your dreams. It’s just tidying up, so easy for people to get stated if they wanna make a change in their messy bedroom, and get inspired in some other aspects in life. What’s better is it’s just a short step-by-step guide on tidying up. Nothing dreadful here.

I started reading the book with the simple intention of finding out what’s it about. As the housing situation I am in now, I didn’t have the chance to implement what the book has been teaching, which has inevitably hindered the book from exposing all its benefits to me. This doesn’t take away its impact though. Some inspiration of minimalism hit me while reading this book. And although no action has been taken, I do reflect on my past way of dealing with all my collection of stuff, which is essentially garbage at this point. And I do, for real, wanna get some reading on minimalism now.
