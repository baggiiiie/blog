The nerdiest title ever?
As I thought of this platform and typed the word Medium in Google search box, I realized it’s been years since I last visited this page.

I was just a casual reader, trying to get some better content to read other than some teenager posting on reddit. But at that time, I was too dull to realize the benefits of reading books. Well, of course I knew it’s good to read books, but maybe too immature, or dull, or dumb, or whatever words you might use, to take actions and actually read a book.

A few years later, to be exactly, three years later, I came back on Medium again. But this time, with a different purpose. Well over the course of three years, I changed and actually for once, I developed the habit of reading now. To be completely fair, this habit only came recently. Yes, it came to me. Just out of nowhere, it just hit me and entered my life. I started reading daily two months ago. Not just some random posts on reddit this time. Well, I wouldn’t really call it reading no more. I started to read some fictions on mobile devices around May, recommended by a female friend, and why i started was probably so we could have more common topics to talk about. And who would have thought this just sticks till now, I still read.

And the above-mentioned different purpose, is to be a writer. Whilst the process of reading quality contents, the urge of taking notes just surges up. I was thinking about making my own blog website, where I have 100% control of the site, and blog whatever I want there, including reading notes. It could take weeks for the website to go through production, and it’s under the circumstances that I’d actually try to complete it. Therefore, no matter what, I should just find somewhere to keep my thoughts. I guess it’s like building assets. At least, once when I actually do have my own blog, it’ rather easy to just copy and paste the whole thing over there, isn’t it?

Alas, what’s up with the fixation of building my own blog. Just journal however you want somewhere. Wanting to journal and having your own blog are completely different subjects anyways.

And there you have it, I am writing my very first article? blog? sh\*tpost? on here. Let’s just see how it goes maybe?
